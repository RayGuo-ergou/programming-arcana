\subsection{C While Loop} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_while_loop}

The while loop is C's \nameref{sub:pre_test_loop}, allowing a block to be repeated zero or more times.

\csyntax{csynt:looping-while-loop}{a While Loop}{looping/while-loop}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item \fref{csynt:looping-while-loop} shows the syntax for a \nameref{sub:pre_test_loop} in C.
  \item This loop runs 0 to many times, checking the condition before executing the body of the loop.
  \item The parenthesis allow the compiler to determine where the condition ends, and the statement starts.
  \item The while loop repeats a single statement, you must use a \nameref{sub:compound_statement} to have multiple statements repeated. See \nameref{sub:c_compound_statement}.
\end{itemize}
