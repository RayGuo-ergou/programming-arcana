\subsection{C Compound Statement} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_compound_statement}

Most of the C structured statements only allow single statements within each path. For example, the paths in the two branches of an \nameref{sub:c_if_statement} can only contain a single statement. The \nameref{sub:compound_statement} allows you to group together multiple statements within a single \emph{compound statement}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \fref{csynt:branching-compound-statement} shows the syntax for a \nameref{sub:compound_statement} in C.
  \item The code in \lref{clst-test-compound} shows an if statement that includes two compound statements within its branches.
  \item Compound statements in C are marked with curly brackets, `\{' for the start, and `\}' for the end.
  \item The compound statement is a standard statement, and can be used anywhere a statement can appear. Its practice use is for grouping statements within other structured statements, and you are unlikely to find it used in any other way.
\end{itemize}
