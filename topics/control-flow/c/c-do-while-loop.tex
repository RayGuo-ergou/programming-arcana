\subsection{C Do While Loop} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_do_while_loop}

The do while loop is C's \nameref{sub:post_test_loop}, allowing a block to be repeated one or more times.

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item \fref{csynt:looping-do-while-loop} shows the syntax for a \nameref{sub:post_test_loop} in C.
  \item This loop runs 1 to many times, checking the condition after executing the body of the loop.
  \item The parenthesis allow the compiler to determine where the condition ends.
  \item The do while loop repeats a single statement, you must use a \nameref{sub:compound_statement} to have multiple statements repeated. See \nameref{sub:c_compound_statement}.
\end{itemize}
