\subsection{C If Statement} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_if_statement}

The if statement is a \nameref{sub:branching} statement. This can be used to optionally run a block of code, providing two alternate paths controlled by a Boolean expression.

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item This is the C syntax for the \nameref{sub:if_statement}.
  \item The parenthesis surround the expression. This enables the compiler to tell where the expression ends.
  \item Notice that the \texttt{else} branch is optional.
  \item When the expression is \texttt{false} (0 in C), the else branch is taken.
  \item For any other value the first path is taken.
  \item You only need to include \texttt{stdbool.h} if you want to use the \texttt{bool} type and the values \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}.
\end{itemize}
