\label{sub:compound_statement}

\nameref{sub:branching} and \nameref{sub:looping} statements need to be able to include a number of instructions within their paths. Often languages will manage this by indicating that only a \emph{single} statement can be included in any of these paths, and then include the ability to code multiple statements in a \emph{single compound statement}.

  \item Compound Statements are useful when combined with \nameref{sub:branching} and \nameref{sub:looping} Statements. Allowing you to put multiple statements within a path.
