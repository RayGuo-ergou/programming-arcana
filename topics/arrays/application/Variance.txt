Function: Variance
----------------------------
Returns: Double - The Variance of the numbers from the data array
Parameters:
 1: data (array of Double) - the list of values
 2: size (Integer) - the number of elements in data (C only)
Local Variables:
 *: i (Integer) - index of the current element in the array
 *: avg (Double) - used to store the mean
 *: temp (Double) - stores a temporary values used in the calculation
Steps:
  1: avg is assigned Mean(data, size)
  2: temp is assigned 0
  3: For i, starts at 0 and loops to the highest index of data
  4:    temp is assigned temp + the square of (the ith element of data - avg)
  5: Return the result, temp / (size - 1)
