\subsection{C Program (with Procedures)} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_program_with_procedures_}

The C code for a Program contains the program's instructions in \texttt{main}, along with your procedure declarations.

\csyntax{csynt:procedure-decl-program}{a Program (with procedures)}{procedure-decl/program-with-procedures}

\csection{\ccode{lst:program-c-say-hello-proc}{Is Anyone There?}{code/c/procedure-decl/say-hello-proc.c}}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item The header includes, main function, and block are all the same as previously seen.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{header include} gives you access to the Standard IO library.
    \item The \emph{main function} is the entry point for your program, it contains the instructions that are followed when the program is launched.
    \item The \emph{block} contains the instructions used within the \texttt{main} function.
  \end{itemize}
  \item You can place \textbf{declarations} after the \emph{header includes} and before the \emph{main function}.
  \item The \emph{declarations} can contain any number of \emph{procedure declarations}. See \nameref{sub:c_procedure_declaration} for details on this code.
  \bigskip
  \item The code in Listing \ref{lst:program-c-say-hello-proc} shows a Program with two procedures: \texttt{say\_hello()} and \texttt{say\_is\_anyone\_there()}.
  \item Notice that these procedures are declared after the \emph{header include} \csnipet{#include <stdio.h>} and before the \emph{main function}.
\end{itemize}
