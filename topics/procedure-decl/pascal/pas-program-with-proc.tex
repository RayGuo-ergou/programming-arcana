\subsection{Pascal Program (with Procedures)} % (fold)
\label{sub:pas_program_with_procedures_}

The Pascal code for a program contains the program's instructions, along with your own procedure declarations.

\passyntax{passynt:procedure-decl-program}{a program (with procedures)}{procedure-decl/program-with-procedures}

\passection{\pascode{lst:program-pas-say-hello-proc}{Is Anyone There?}{code/pascal/procedure-decl/SayHelloProc.pas}}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Within your program you can declare your own procedures. 
  \item See \nameref{sub:pas_procedure_declaration} for the syntax to declare your own procedures.
  \item Listing \ref{lst:program-pas-say-hello-proc} shows a program with three procedures: \texttt{Main}, \texttt{ SayHello()}, and \texttt{ SayIsAnyoneThere()}.
  \item Procedures are declared between the \emph{program's header} and the \emph{program's statements}.
\end{itemize}
