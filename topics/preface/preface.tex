Welcome to the Programming Arcana. This book focuses on programming concepts, and gives you the option of programming these using either the C or Pascal programming language. Both languages are very capable, with each having their own advantages and disadvantages. Pascal was designed as a teaching language and is easy to program with while still being very capable. C is very flexible and is the basis for a number of other languages.

If you want, or need, to learn to program then you can not do this just by reading a book, even one as magical as this. Learning to program requires practice. This book is designed to give you the concepts you need in order to understand how to go about creating your first programs. To really understand these concepts you need to apply them to the creation of your own programs.

When you are getting started, programming can appear quite daunting and the tools you use can be unforgiving. Work through these initial challenges, and with practice you will be able to overcome them. Once you have some success there is nothing better than seeing a program you created running on a computer. You have brought the machine to life, getting it to perform a task the way you want it performed. Once you get a program working it can become easy to get hooked and working on new features and functions becomes a real joy. The greater the challenge the program offers, the greater your sense of achievement when you see the working product in operation.

Other people are the best resources to help you get over these initial challenges. Fellow students studying this material can provide you with support, and a chance to discuss the challenges you are facing. Teaching staff are also a good resource when you are really stuck. If you do not have access to anyone who can help, use discussion boards and websites. Getting the right help will make a large difference to your learning experience.

Remember that you will need to study this material. That is not just reading it, but thinking and reflecting on what you have read. Try to think about each of the concepts, and how they relate to the other material that has been presented to you. Try to design and build your own programs with the material you are learning. If you do think deeply and apply the concepts to programs you create, you will eventually get the light bulb moment when things become clear and programming can become truly joyful.
