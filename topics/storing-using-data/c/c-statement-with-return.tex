\label{sub:c_statement_with_return_statement_}

The different statements of a Programming Language allow you to command the Computer to perform different actions. We have covered three kinds of statements so far.

\csyntax{csynt:function-decl-statement}{Statements (with Return Statement)}{function-decl/statement-with-return}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item At this point you have seen how to command the computer to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Call a Procedure (\texttt{void} Function) using a \textbf{procedure call}.
    \item Assign a value to a Variable using an \textbf{Assignment Statement}.
    \item End the current Function or Procedure, and return a value to the caller using a \textbf{Return Statement}.
  \end{itemize}
  \item These Statements can be placed within the \emph{blocks} of the Functions and Procedures of your Programs.
\end{itemize}
