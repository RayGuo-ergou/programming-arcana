\subsection{C Procedure Declaration (with Local Variables)} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_procedure_declaration_with_local_variables_}

The Functions and Procedures in C can contain declaration for \nameref{sub:local_variable}s.

\csyntax{csynt:storing-using-data-procedure-decl}{Procedure Declaration (with Local Variables)}{storing-using-data/procedure-decl-with-locals}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item This is the syntax for declaring \nameref{sub:local_variable}s in a Procedure.
  \item See Listing \ref{lst:variable-test-c} for an example of declaring Local Variables.
  \item In Listing \ref{lst:variable-test-c} \ldots
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{test} procedure has two local variables: \texttt{my\_local} and \texttt{another\_local}.
    \item The \texttt{main} function has one local variable called \texttt{local\_int}.
  \end{itemize}
  \item The Local Variables must be declared before the statements within the Function and Procedure's block.
  \item In C you cannot declare variables after the first statement in the block.
  \item In this text we will use a common C convention of having all \emph{Local Variables} in \textbf{lower case}, with underscores ( \_ ) used to separate words. So the \emph{My Name} local variable becomes \texttt{my\_name}.
  
\end{itemize}
