\subsection{C Procedure Declaration (as Function)} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_procedure_declaration_as_function_}

C does not have a strong separation of Functions and Procedures. Instead, in C all Procedures are Functions that return a special \texttt{void} \nameref{sub:type}. This means that the standard C Syntax does not include a separate definition for Procedure declarations. Even though C does not have direct syntax for Procedures, the concept is still very important.

\csyntax{csynt:function-decl-procedure-decl}{a Procedure (as a Function)}{function-decl/procedure-decl}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item In C all Procedures are Functions that return a \texttt{void} type.
  \item The \texttt{void} type indicates an \emph{empty} type. This indicates that Procedures return no data to the caller.
\end{itemize}
}
