\subsubsection{C++ Reference Parameters} % (fold)
\label{ssub:c_reference_parameters}

C has limited support for pass by reference, but this feature was added with the extensions in the C++ language. The following syntax shows how to declare a parameter that will be passed by reference. Please note that this is not standard C code, and will require you to use a C++ compiler.

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item This requires a \textbf{C++ compiler}, such as the \texttt{g++} compiler.
  \item C++ to an extension of the C compiler, so your C code should be able to be compiled with the C++ compiler.
  \item The C++ compiler is more strict on some rules than the C compiler. This means the compiler will give you more help in avoiding some poor programming practices.
  \item Notice that with pass by reference you do not need to do anything special in the call, the compiler takes care of the necessary details needed to achieve this.
\end{itemize}
