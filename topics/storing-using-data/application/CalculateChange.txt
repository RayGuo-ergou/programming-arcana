   1: Return the result of Change divided by Coin Value
  
  Procedure: Output Change Data
  ----------------------------
  Parameters:
   1: Number Given (Integer)
   2: Coin Description (String)
  Steps:
   1: Output Number Given, ' x ', and the Coin Description
  
Variables:
 * Cost of Item (Integer)
 * Payment (Integer)
 * Change Value (Integer)
 * To Give (Integer)
Steps:
 1: Output 'Cost of item (in cents): '
 2: Read a number into Cost of Item
 3: Output 'Amount paid (in cents): '
 4: Read a number into Payment
 5: Assign to Change Value the value Payment - Cost of Item
 6: To Give = Coins to Give(Change Value, TWO_DOLLARS)
 7: Change Value = Change Value - To Give * TWO_DOLLARS
 8: Call Output Change Data( To Give, '$2' )
 9: To Give = Coins to Give(Change Value, ONE_DOLLAR)
10: Change Value = Change Value - To Give * ONE_DOLLAR
11: Call Output Change Data( To Give, '$1' )
12: To Give = Coins to Give(Change Value, FIFTY_CENTS)
13: Change Value = Change Value - To Give * FIFTY_CENTS
14: Call Output Change Data( To Give, '50c' )
15: To Give = Coins to Give(Change Value, TWENTY_CENTS)
16: Change Value = Change Value - To Give * TWENTY_CENTS
17: Call Output Change Data( To Give, '20c' )
18: To Give = Coins to Give(Change Value, TEN_CENTS)
19: Change Value = Change Value - To Give * TEN_CENTS
20: Call Output Change Data( To Give, '10c' )
21: To Give = Coins to Give(Change Value, FIVE_CENTS)
22: Change Value = Change Value - To Give * FIVE_CENTS
23: Call Output Change Data( To Give, '5c' )
