When you are programming you will spend most of your time in a Text Editor. The best kinds of editors for program code include \emph{syntax highlighting} where the editor uses details about the language to highlight parts of the code as you write it. This can make it easier to find and fix small errors as you go.

There are many different syntax highlighting text editors, each will support different programming languages and operating systems. We recommend that you use Visual Studio Code. It is fast, extensible, cross platform, and free! The details of how to install this and configure it for your language are on the SplashKit website.
