\subsubsection{Installing fpc on Mac OS} % (fold)
\label{ssub:installing_gcc_on_mac_os}

To install \textbf{fpc} on Mac OS you need to install the \textbf{XCode} developer tools, and then the \textbf{Free Pascal Compiler}. You can get the latest version of XCode from the \textbf{Mac App Store}, and then download and install the Free Pascal Compiler from their website.

\begin{itemize}
  \item XCode links:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Apple's XCode website \url{http://developer.apple.com/xcode/}
    \item Mac App Store  \url{http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12}
    \item For older version of Mac OS, download from \href{https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_3.2.2_developer_tools_beta_20728/xcode322_2148_developerdvd.dmg}{Apple's developer site}.\footnote{These will require you to have an Apple Developer account, which can be done for free at \url{http://developer.apple.com/programs/register}.}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Free Pascal links:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The Free Pascal Website \url{http://freepascal.org}
    \item Download the compiler from \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/freepascal/files/} 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Installing gcc on Windows} % (fold)
\label{ssub:installing_gcc_on_windows}

To install \textbf{fpc} on Windows you need to install the \textbf{MinGW} program and the \textbf{Free Pascal Compiler}. This includes the MinGW Shell, the Terminal equivalent for Windows. Read the Getting Started page from the links below, and follow the steps for the \textbf{Graphical User Interface Installer}. When following the installer make sure that you choose to install the MinGW Shell as well as the C and C++ compilers.

\begin{itemize}
  \item MinGW:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The project's Website \url{www.mingw.org}
    \item Instructions for installing MinGW: \url{http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started}
    \item Follow the link from the Getting Started article, or download MinGW from Source Forge at \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/}
    \item It is a good idea to restart after installing MinGW to make sure all its settings are applied.
  \end{itemize}

  \item Free Pascal links:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The Free Pascal Website \url{http://freepascal.org}
    \item Download the compiler from \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/freepascal/files/} 
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Testing fpc has installed} % (fold)
\label{ssub:testing_your_install_fpc}

To test that you have successfully installed gcc you can do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Open a Terminal window. (See the notes on the \nameref{sub:terminal} page for the location of the Terminal program)
  \item At the terminal type \textbf{\texttt{fpc}}. You should see something similar to \fref{fig:fpc-install}. If you see the message `\texttt{-bash: fpc: command not found}' this means the install has not worked correctly. Please review the install steps for your Operating System or get someone to check your install.
\end{enumerate}
