  {W}{elcome} neophyte! So you seek to master the art of Magic? To work magic you must learn the structure of incantations, and how to use a wand to convert these into magic energy. 
  
  Let us begin with a simple spell, a spell that will greet the world around you! Utter these words, and wave your wand\ldots

Welcome to the Programming Arcana\footnote{Arcana is defined as secrets or mysteries, Wiktionary defines it as ``specialized knowledge that is mysterious to the uninitiated.''. This fits well with the idea of programming, and we think its a cool word to describe the \emph{magic} of programming!}, a book about learning to program. This book contains a number of chapters that take you from knowing nothing, or little, about programming to a position where the mysteries are revealed. By the end of the material you will be able to create your own programs and you will be ready to start learning other programming languages and approaches to software development.

This book is divided into a number of chapters, each of which introduces you to a programming task and the arcane knowledge that must be attained to understand how the task is accomplished. As with any arcane knowledge there are special terms that are used by those who know its secrets. In each chapter you will be introduced to the terms you need to understand in order to perform the current task. This will provide you with the tools you need to describe programs to other software developers, and will help you understand how the structures within your programs work to achieve their goals.

Like magic, you must learn the structure of source code, and how to use tools to convert these into programs. Let us begin with a simple program, a program that will greet the world.

\section{Concepts Related to Building Programs} % (fold)
\label{sec:concepts_related_to_building_programs}

In this chapter you will learn about the basic tools you need to use to create your own programs. You will see an example program, and then use these tools to convert that code into an executable program. You will then be able to run the program you created, and see it perform the tasks you coded.

This chapter provides a background on what programs are, and the general processes of how they are created. This will introduce you to the tools you will be using, and fill in some details of what they are doing and how to use them. The topics covered include the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \nameref{sub:what_is_a_program_}: This section introduces you to the idea of what a program is, and what it contains. You will need to be familiar with programs and what they are, as you will need to be able to create your own.
  \item \nameref{sub:machine_code}: Talks about the kinds of instructions the computer understands, and why it is not very productive to work at this level. You need to understand that this exists behind the scenes, but do not need to be overly familiar with it.
  \item \nameref{sub:assembly}: The next level of language is called Assembly. It is very close to machine code, but much easier to understand and use. However, this is still too low a level to be very productive. Just like machine code, you only need to know this exists
  \item \nameref{sub:source_code_and_the_compiler}: This is the level we are going to be working with in this book. This code is much easier to work with than assembly, and allows you to create your own programs reasonably quickly once you have learnt the basics. These are the tools you are going to be working with throughout this text.
  \item \nameref{sub:terminal}: This is a command line environment that lets you issue text commands to the user. You will use this to create and run your programs.
  \item \nameref{sub:hello world}: A \emph{classic} program used to check that you have everything working correctly. This section shows you the code that you can use this to check that you have all the tools setup correctly, and to check their usage.
  \item \nameref{sub:compiling_code}: This final section will show you how to use these tools to compile and run your own Hello World program. \fref{fig:run-1-helloworld} shows the Hello World program running from the Terminal.
\end{itemize}

Before getting into these details the next section provides you will an outline of the book, and how you can go about reading it.

\section{Understanding Program Compilation} % (fold)
\label{sec:understanding_program_compilation}

An in depth look at how programs and compilers work is beyond the scope of this book. Instead, this chapter focuses on two aspects that can help you understand why we need compilers, and how these are able to help us. These topics are \nameref{sub:levels_of_abstraction}, followed by \nameref{sub:computers_and_intelligent_behaviour}.

\subsection{Levels of Abstraction} % (fold)
\label{sub:levels_of_abstraction}

Programs are very complicated. Trying to keep all of the details about how it works in focus all of the time would take a large amount of effort, and slow you down. As humans we have developed strategies for dealing with these kinds of situations. What we do is create \emph{layers} of abstraction.

A layer, or level, of abstraction provides a means of managing details at a similar level of detail. This means that all aspects of that level are similar, and related to each other. When you are working at a certain level, you think in terms of the tools and artefacts that are available to you. 

These levels build on top of each other, with each layer being built on top of the lower layer, and providing the foundation for the next higher layer. Within a layer of abstraction you do not need to think about the lower levels of abstraction, most of the time. However, it is always good to know the details of at least one level of abstraction below the level you are working at.

\subsubsection{Programming Abstraction Levels} % (fold)
\label{ssub:programming_abstraction_levels}

Computers are unintelligent. This is one of the first, and most important, things you need to understand when starting to create your own programs. A computer is a machine that can be programmed using \nameref{sub:machine_code}. These binary commands instruct the computer to perform basic actions such as adding numbers, reading values from memory, storing values in memory, jumping to new instructions elsewhere in memory, and other simple tasks. While this is a very low level, it is not the lowest level of abstraction.

Below machine code, there is the abstraction for \textbf{binary}. This is the idea that you can have a number system based on two digits, 0 and 1. The machine code level builds on this idea, creating a set of instructions that can be used to tell the computer what to do. Below binary there is the concept of \textbf{gates}, which are themselves built on top of \textbf{electronic circuits}, which in turn are made from \textbf{discrete electronic components}. Even these low level electronic components are based upon something else, but to discuss this we would need to delve into the realm of \textbf{semiconductors} and \textbf{Quantum Mechanics}. From machine code you can also work up to \nameref{sub:assembly}, and then to \nameref{sub:source_code_and_the_compiler}.

Whenever you are working on something you need to be able to work at that level of abstraction, and have an understanding of the level below, and the level above. For programming this means that you will need to understand of the tools provided to you by the language (a level below), and you need to understand the features and functions of the program you are creating (a level above).

In this book the \emph{Understanding} section of each chapter will help you see how the concepts covered work at a lower level of abstraction. Often this means these sections are very detailed. You should read these sections to understand how the abstractions (concepts) covered in the chapter work, at a level of abstraction lower than you will be working at.

\subsection{Computers and Intelligent Behaviour} % (fold)
\label{sub:computers_and_intelligent_behaviour}

If computers are unintelligent, how can they do the awesome things they do?

That is a good question. Computers are unintelligent, but programs are not. The computer does not \emph{know} what it is doing. It is following a set of steps that was coded into the program being executed. These steps, however, were created by people, software developers. When a computer does something cool, its because a person told it to do that.

This is why it can be really great fun to be a software developer. You get to make computers do things you want them to. This creativity can be really exhilarating when you finally get your program to do exactly what you want.
