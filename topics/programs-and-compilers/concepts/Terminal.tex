Once you have written some source code, you need to be able to compile it. This means, you need to run the \textbf{compiler}, and give it your source code files to compile. The best way to do this when you really want to learn about programming, is to run the compiler directly yourself.

The problem with compilers is that they are not large programs with graphical user interfaces. They are small programs that must be given the files to compile when they start, and stop once these files are compiled. While there are tools around that hide the compiler from you, the best way to really learn how these tools work is to interact with them yourself. To do this you needed to user a \textbf{Terminal} program.

The Terminal is a program that gives you \textbf{command line access} to the computer. With command line access you can enter text commands to start programs. These programs can output details back to the Terminal for you to read, and interactive programs can also read input from you via this same Terminal.

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item On Ubuntu \textbf{Linux} you can find the Terminal in the \emph{Accessories} folder within \emph{Applications}. See Figure \ref{fig:program-creation-ubuntu-terminal}.
  \item On \textbf{MacOS} you can find the Terminal in the \emph{Utilities} folder within \emph{Applications}. See Figure \ref{fig:program-creation-macos-terminal}.
  \item On \textbf{Windows} you will need to download and install \emph{MinGW}, making sure to select the \emph{MinSYS} option during the install process. The \emph{MinGW Shell} is then the equivalent of Terminal on the other operating systems. You will find this in \emph{Program Files}, \emph{MinGW}. See Figure \ref{fig:program-creation-mingw-shell}.

\subsubsection{The Shell} % (fold)
\label{ssub:the_shell}

The \textbf{Terminal} program itself just provides a text environment, allowing text input and output. Within this environment a \textbf{Shell} program is run to interpret your commands. This is an interactive program that will display a prompt to you, at which you enter your commands.

There are a number of different Shell programs, each of which has its own set of instructions. The Shell we are going to use in this book is called \textbf{Bash}. This shell program is available on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. As a Unix shell it is native for Linux and Mac OS, and with Windows you can install \textbf{MinGW} to use these commands.

   \label{fig:bash}
\end{figure}

A shell program is very simple. It provides a text prompt at which you can enter commands. The Shell then reads the text you entered, and performs an action based on the text you entered. You can use the Shell to perform operations like copying and deleting files, and starting programs.

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item The name `Shell' came from idea that this was the outermost \emph{shell} of the computer, the interface between the user and the computer's internals.
  \item Bash stands for `\emph{Bourne-again shell}', as Bash is a replacement for the \emph{Bourne} shell.
  \item It will take some time to get used to using Bash, but the more you learn about it the more useful it will become.

\subsubsection{Using Bash} % (fold)
\label{ssub:bash}

To get started using the Terminal, you will need to know some details of how Bash works, and some of the most basic bash commands.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{5cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Action} & \textbf{Command} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Change Directory & \texttt{cd} & Moves the shell to a different working directory. \\
    \hline
    Print Working Directory & \texttt{pwd} & Outputs the current working directory.\\
    \hline
    List Files & \texttt{ls} & Outputs a list of files.\\
    \hline
    Copy File(s) & \texttt{cp} & Copies files from one location to another.\\
    \hline
    Move File(s) & \texttt{mv} & Moves files from one location to another.\\
    \hline
    Delete File(s) & \texttt{rm} & Removes files from the computer. There is no recycle bin with this, so take care!\\
    \hline
    Create a Directory & \texttt{mkdir} & Makes a new directory. \\
    \hline
    
    
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

To get started with Bash, you need to understand a little bit about the \textbf{file system}. Each operating system needs a way of storing its files, and there are going to be lots of files stored on a computer. This means that it would be cumbersome to try and keep these all in one place. Instead, the Operating System places files in \textbf{directories} (also known as \emph{Folders}). A directory can contain files, and other directories. 

When you are working in Bash, you will have a \textbf{working directory}. This is the directory where Bash will start searching for the files you are interacting with. The standard way of working with Bash is to \emph{change} to the directory with the files you want to work with, and then you can use the filenames directly.
