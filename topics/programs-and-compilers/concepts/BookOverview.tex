This book focuses on programming concepts, and gives you the option of programming these using either the C or Pascal programming language. Both languages are very capable, with each having their own advantages and disadvantages. Pascal was designed as a teaching language and is easy to program with while still being very capable. C is very flexible and is the basis for a number of other languages.
