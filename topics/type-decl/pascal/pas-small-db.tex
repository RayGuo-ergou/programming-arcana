\subsection{Implementing Small DB in Pascal} % (fold)
\label{sub:implementing_small_db_in_pas}

\sref{sec:using_custom_types} of this Chapter introduced the Small DB program. A partial implementation of this program is shown in \lref{lst:pas-small-db}. The type definitions, and code are missing the details needed to store and display double values. This program reads a number of rows of data from the user (determined by the \texttt{DB\_SIZE} constant). Each row stores a single value, being either a double value, an integer value, or a text value.

\straightcode{\pascode{lst:pas-small-db}{Pascal code for the Small DB program}{code/pascal/types/SmallDB.pas}}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{trim} function removes spaces from the start and the end of the input, ensuring that numbers with leading or trailing spaces are still detected as numbers.
  \item The type definitions must appear before they are used, as a result they commonly appear at the start of the code after the includes.
\end{itemize}
