Type declarations allow you to define your own types. Programming Languages offer a range of different code structures you can use to build your own types.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A type declaration is the \textbf{term} given for declaring your own type \emph{artefact} in code.
  \item Programming Languages offer a range of different kinds of types that you can create.
  \item Each kind of type declaration allows you to create a type for different kinds of values:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enum}: An enumeration is creates a type where the value will be one of a list of available options.
    \item \textbf{Record} or \textbf{Struct}: A structured record, where each value of this type is made up of a number of fields.
    \item \textbf{Union} or \textbf{Variant Record}: Makes it possible to create a type where the value could be one of a number of other types.
    \item Languages may also offer other kinds of type you can declare.
  \end{itemize}
  \item You use these different kind of types to design the structure for the values you will work with in your code.
  \item There is no data associated with a type declaration, you are declaring a new format, not another value.
\end{itemize}
