\subsection{Pascal Comments} % (fold)
\label{sub:pas_comments}

Comments allow you to embed documentation and explanatory text within your program's code. The comments are skipped by the compiler, so they have no affect on the program's machine code. You write comments to help other people understand what you intend the program to do.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \fref{passynt:program-creation-comment} shows the syntax for comments in Pascal.
  \item Block comments can span multiple lines.
  \item You can type almost anything in the comment, represented by the \texttt{...} in the diagram.
  \item A compiler ignores comments when compiling your code.
\end{itemize}
