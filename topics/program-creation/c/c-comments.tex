\subsection{C Comments} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_comments}

Comments allow you to embed documentation and explanatory text within your program's code. The comments are skipped by the compiler, so they have no affect on the program's machine code. You write comments to help other people understand what you intend the program to do.

\mynote {
\begin{itemize}
  \item Figure \ref{csynt:program-creation-comment} shows the syntax for comments in C.
  \item In standard C the first style of comments must be used, \csnipet{/* Comment */}.
  \item Most modern C compilers also allow single line comments using \csnipet{// Comment}.
  \item The standard C comments can span multiple lines, these are good for block comments.
  \item The compiler ignores comments when compiling your code.
  \item You can type anything in the comment, the \texttt{...} in the diagram.
\end{itemize}
