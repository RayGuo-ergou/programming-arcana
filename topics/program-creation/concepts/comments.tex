\subsection{Comments} % (fold)
\label{sub:comments}

A program's source code contains instructions for the actions the computer must perform. However, this code is written and maintained by people. It is often useful to be able to place comments in the code to help someone reading that code understand how the code works or what it is trying to achieve. This text is not something that should be translated into machine code.

Programming languages support the ability for programmers to embed \emph{comments} into the source code that are ignored by the compiler.

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is good practice to place a comment at the top of your code explaining what the program does.
  \item Comments should be included to help other people read your code. You will also find these comments useful when you return to your code after a long break.
  \item Make your comments meaningful, try to capture your intentions and ideas.
  \item Comments have no impact on the output produced by the compiler.
\end{itemize}
