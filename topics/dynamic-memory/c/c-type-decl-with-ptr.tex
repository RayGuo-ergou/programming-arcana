\subsection{C Type Declarations (with pointers)} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_type_decl_with_ptrs}

In C you can declare custom types that make use of pointers. This includes alias types, structs, and unions.

\csyntax{csynt:type-decl-with-ptr}{array and alias type declarations with pointers}{dynamic-memory/type-decl-with-ptrs}

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item This is the C syntax to for custom alias type that include \nameref{sub:pointer}s.
  \item The main difference is the inclusion of the \texttt{*} in the \emph{direct type declaration}. This indicates that the custom type can alias pointer types. This would allow you to declare a type such as \texttt{person\_ptr} that is a pointer to a person.
  \item  The \emph{inner type declaration} allows you to have array of pointers, and pointers to arrays. In these cases you use the brackets to indicate if you want to declare a pointer to an array, or an array of pointers. See \lref{clst:test-type-alias-ptr} for an example of these type declarations.
