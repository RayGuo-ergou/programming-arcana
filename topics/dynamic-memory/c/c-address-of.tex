\subsection{C Pointer Operators} % (fold)
\label{sub:c_pointer_operators}

C provides a number of pointer operators that allow you to get and use pointers.

  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{8cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Operator}  & \textbf{Example}  & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Address Of & \texttt{\&} & \texttt{\&x} & Gets a pointer to the variable/field etc. \\
    \hline
    Dereference & \texttt{*} & \texttt{*ptr} & Follow the pointer, and read the value it points to.\\
    \hline
    & \texttt{->} & \texttt{ptr->field\_name} & Follow a pointer to a struct or union, and read a field value. \\
    \hline
    & \texttt{[]} & \texttt{ptr[2]} & Allows you to access a pointer as if it were an array. \\

You can get a pointer to a value using the ampersand operator (\&). This operator lets you get the address of the variable, field, etc of the

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item The address of operator gets a pointer to the value in the expression that follows it.
  \item Dereference means `\emph{follow the pointer, and read what it points to}'.
  \item Use the asterisks (\texttt{*}) to dereference the pointer and get the value it points to.
  \item You can use \texttt{->} to dereference a pointer to a structure value, and then to read one of the fields from within the structure. 
  \item \lref{clst:pointer_operators} shows how you can get addresses of different variables, and how you can access the value pointed to using \texttt{*} and \texttt{->}.
