[Sequence](03-build-simple-sequences/01-sequence) is at the heart of all imperative programming languages. This concept underpins how you approach coding, think about programs, and understand how they work. In this chapter, you will see how code runs as a sequence of machine code instructions. Using just a few simple commands, you will create some small visualisations to test out these ideas.

Paired with Sequence is the concept of [variables](03-build-simple-sequences/02-variables), and variable [declarations](03-build-simple-sequences/03-declarations). Variables allow you to store and manipulate data in the programs you create. The ability to manipulate data is at the core of all programs. This section will help you see the two parts of all programs: instructions and data. Data is further explored in [expressions](03-build-simple-sequences/04-expressions), when we review how programming languages capture values in the code we write.

Next, we look at [Grouping](03-build-simple-sequences/04-group) instructions into reusable blocks you can call on to perform tasks, and start to look at programming language [Syntax](03-build-simple-sequences/04-syntax) as a means of communicating the structures you need to follow when writing code.

The chapter concludes by helping you see how to pull these concepts together to make some small programs. [Sequence in Action](03-build-simple-sequences/07-in-action.md) shows some demo programs together with details on creating [Terminal Programs](03-build-simple-sequences/07-in-action/01-terminal-programs.md), [Drawing Shapes](03-build-simple-sequences/07-in-action/02-drawing.md), [Playing Sound Effects](03-build-simple-sequences/07-in-action/03-sound-effects.md), and [Animation Basics](03-build-simple-sequences/07-in-action/04-animation-basics.md). Following this, [Sequence Demystified and Decoded](02-sequence/3-demistified)) talks you through how to approach using these concepts to design your own programs. Lastly, the [Projects](03-build-simple-sequences/09-projects.md) section provides some example projects you can use to put these ideas into practice.


:::note Learning Outcomes
At the end of **Build Simple Sequences** you should be able to:

- Design, code, compile and run programs involving sequences of instructions.
- Describe the central role of sequence in programming.
- Describe how data can be stored, used, and manipulated in programs.
- Describe the sequence of actions involved in:
  - calling a procedure.
  - assigning a value to a variable.
- Write code that includes:
  - sequences of instructions.
  - variables to store values you want to manipulate.
  - procedures to group instructions into reusable packages.
- Identify expressions within programming statements.
- Identify and distinguish between:
  - variable declarations and use.
  - procedure declarations and use.
- Read and use syntax diagrams to write valid programming statements.
