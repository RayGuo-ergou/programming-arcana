Software development involves the use of software tools. This chapter focuses on the tools that you will need to start building programs.

## Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Write source code using a text editor
- Use command-line tools in the terminal to compile source code.

You will understand the role of these different tools, why they are needed, and how to use them to create programs. You will be able to:

- Explain the role of the tools used in creating a program (editor, terminal, compiler, interpreter)
- Describe the difference between source code and machine code
- Read and interpret syntax diagrams and text used to describe programming language rules



Programming involves defining the list of instructions you want the computer to perform when your program runs. You could create the program by writing out the specific machine code instructions, but this has several challenges:

- Computer read and execute **machine code** - binary codes unique to each CPU.
- Each instruction only performs a simple action, such as a single mathematical operation (multiplication, addition, subtraction, division) storing a value in memory or reading a single value from memory.
- Even a simple program would involve thousands of instructions.
