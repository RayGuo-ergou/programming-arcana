Learning to program is all about learning to build programs. So what is a program?

A program is a file that contains instructions for the computer to perform a task. Programs are lists of commands telling the computer what to do and the order to do it. Each of these commands is very simple. Computers execute these commands very quickly, allowing them to perform quite remarkable feats.

\begin{itemize}
  \item You can \textbf{run} programs, which gets the computer to follow the instructions found within the program's file.
  \item To run, the program's instructions must first be loaded into memory.
  \item Once in memory, the computer starts running the instructions one after the other.
  \item When the last instruction is completed the program ends.
  \item There are several different ways to run a program:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You can \emph{double-click} the program in a file browser.
    \item On tablets and app-phones you can \emph{tap} the program's icon.
    \item Advanced uses can enter \emph{text commands} in the Terminal to start programs.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

When you run a program, regardless of how it is started, the Operating System loads it from disk into memory and then starts it running. It is important that the file you try to run is a program. These are \emph{special} files that contain instructions the computer can understand.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Your Operating System is a piece of software that is responsible for managing your computer's hardware.
  \item One of the Operating System's responsibilities is to start programs.
  \item The terminal can be used to start programs.
  \item Programs can also output to the terminal.
  \item A Program must contain instructions that the computer can understand.
\end{itemize}
