Paired with Sequence is the concept of [variables](03-build-simple-sequences/02-variables), and variable [declarations](03-build-simple-sequences/03-declarations). Variables allow you to store and manipulate data in the programs you create. The ability to manipulate data is at the core of all programs. This section will help you see the two parts of all programs: instructions and data. Data is further explored in [expressions](03-build-simple-sequences/04-expressions), when we review how programming languages capture values in the code we write.
