==Creating Video Keynotes==

Prior to working with these, make sure you have installed the fonts.

1. Copy the template from the root folder.
2. Adjust to ensure using the correct graphics for the video type
3. Add a "red" flag to the new file to indicate you are working on it!
4. Work on it with the safety to know others wont touch it...
5. When done, remove the "red" flag

We will use the following flags to track video status:
* **Grey**, the file is inactive. Others can start work on it if needed.
* **Red**, someone is working on this file. Hands off!
* **Purple**, needs to be reviewed.
* **Blue**, we need to record audio for this file.
* **Yellow**, we are ready to export, post process, and publish.
* **Green**, file is complete (i.e. published)
